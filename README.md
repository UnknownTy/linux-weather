# linux-weather
Linux Weather is a very basic system service for linux devices, created in Ubuntu.
Linux Weather updates the system's MOTD hourly with the system's local weather.
This is done using data from [wttr.in](http://wttr.in/) [(Github Link)](https://github.com/chubin/wttr.in).

## Installation {#install-id}

Linux-weather should work with most linux systems that use systemctl.
